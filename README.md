# Covid_19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Covid-19 data over time. As my 2nd project, I explored and visualized various aspects of the pandemic using SQL queries. The data used in this project was obtained from the `covid_deaths` table in the database.

## Tableau Visualization
To further enhance the insights derived from the SQL analysis, I also created captivating visualizations using Tableau. You can find the Tableau dashboard by following this [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jehan.engineer/viz/CovidData_16902546331330/Dashboard1#1). The Tableau dashboard showcases the trends and patterns found in the Covid-19 data, providing a comprehensive visual representation of the analysis.

## Project Structure
- `SQL_Analysis.sql`: This file contains the SQL queries used for analyzing the Covid-19 data, including identifying countries with the highest infection rates, examining employment trends, and exploring regional variations in infection levels.

## Results
The project's SQL analysis and Tableau visualizations offer valuable insights into the Covid-19 pandemic, helping us understand its impact on different countries and regions over time.

## Usage
You can use the SQL queries in `SQL_Analysis.sql` to replicate the analysis on your own system or database. Additionally, the Tableau dashboard provides an interactive way to explore the visualizations created using the project's data.

Feel free to explore the data and visualization, and I welcome any feedback or suggestions to improve the project.
